# PROP

Project done for the PROP course at the UPC(Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya).

The core of the project was learning about Data Structures and implementing the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to make a schedule
for doctor's guards in a hospital.

The approaching of the problem was about finding the best bipartite graph done by the doctor's restrictions and then use 
the maximum flow problem to solve the schedule.
